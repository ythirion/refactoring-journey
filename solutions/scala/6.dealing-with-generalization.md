# 6. Dealing with Generalization
## [Pull up methods or Fields](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/journey/6-dealing-with-generalization.html#pull-up-method-or-fields)

* Open `Event` in `dealing.with.generalization` package
* Identify what should be in the Event class

```scala
abstract class Event {}

case class Concert(description: String) extends Event {
  // running / startTime / stopTime can be pulled up
  private var running: Boolean = false
  private var startTime: Long = 0
  private var stopTime: Long = 0
  private var volume: Int = 0

  // start / stop-end / getElapsedTime-calculateElapsedTime
  def start(): Try[Boolean] = {
    if (running) {
      Failure(new IllegalStateException("Concert is already in progress"))
    }
    else {
      startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
      running = true

      Success(running)
    }
  }

  def stop(): Unit = {
    if (running) {
      running = false
      stopTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
    }
  }

  def getElapsedTime: Long = {
    if (running) System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime
    else stopTime - startTime
  }

  def volumeUp(increase: Int): Unit = {
    volume += increase
  }

  def volumeDown(decrease: Int): Unit = {
    volume -= decrease
  }
}

case class TheaterPiece(description: String,
                        numberOfActors: Int) extends Event {
  private var running: Boolean = false
  private var startTime: Long = 0
  private var stopTime: Long = 0

  def start(): Try[Boolean] = {
    if (running) {
      Failure(new IllegalStateException("Piece is already in progress"))
    }
    else {
      startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
      running = true

      Success(running)
    }
  }

  def end(): Unit = {
    if (running) {
      running = false
      stopTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
    }
  }

  def calculateElapsedTime: Long = {
    if (running) System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime
    else stopTime - startTime
  }
}
```

* Once identified pull the fields manually
  * Automatic for java
  * Make them protected
  * Delete them from `Concert` and `TheaterPiece`

```scala
abstract class Event {
  protected var running: Boolean = false
  protected var startTime: Long = 0
  protected var stopTime: Long = 0
}
```

* Pull up start
  * Use the class name for the error message

```scala
def start(): Try[Boolean] = {
  if (running) {
    Failure(new IllegalStateException(s"${this.getClass.getSimpleName} is already in progress"))
  }
  else {
    startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
    running = true

    Success(running)
  }
}
```

* Pull up `end/stop` method
  * Fix a name
  * Stop fits better with start

* Pull up `calculateElapsedTime`
  * Fix the name as well
* Make the fields private
  * `Event` class is responsible to manage those
  * Not its potential children classes

```scala
abstract class Event {
  private var running: Boolean = false
  private var startTime: Long = 0
  private var stopTime: Long = 0

  def start(): Try[Boolean] = {
    if (running) {
      Failure(new IllegalStateException(s"${this.getClass.getSimpleName} is already in progress"))
    }
    else {
      startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
      running = true

      Success(running)
    }
  }

  def stop(): Unit = {
    if (running) {
      running = false
      stopTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
    }
  }

  def calculateElapsedTime: Long = {
    if (running) System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime
    else stopTime - startTime
  }
}
```

* Final state :

```scala
case class TheaterPiece(description: String, numberOfActors: Int) extends Event

case class Concert(description: String) extends Event {
  private var volume: Int = 0

  def volumeUp(increase: Int): Unit = {
    volume += increase
  }

  def volumeDown(decrease: Int): Unit = {
    volume -= decrease
  }
}
```



## [Extract superclass](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/journey/6-dealing-with-generalization.html#extract-superclass)

* Open `Customer` and `Prospect` in `dealing.with.generalization` package
* Identify what should  be in a super class :

```scala
// name, email, phone, creationDate, messages should be in a superclass
case class Customer(name: String,
                    email: String,
                    phone: String,
                    creationDate: LocalDate,
                    conversionDate: LocalDate,
                    messages: List[String])

case class Prospect(name: String,
                    email: String,
                    phone: String,
                    creationDate: LocalDate,
                    messages: List[String])
```

* Create an abstract class Party that will act as super class

```scala
abstract class Party(val name: String,
                     val email: String,
                     val phone: String,
                     val creationDate: LocalDate,
                     val messages: List[String])

class Customer(name: String,
               email: String,
               phone: String,
               creationDate: LocalDate,
               val conversionDate: LocalDate,
               messages: List[String]) extends Party(name, email, phone, creationDate, messages)

class Prospect(name: String,
               email: String,
               phone: String,
               creationDate: LocalDate,
               messages: List[String]) extends Party(name, email, phone, creationDate, messages)
```



## [Extract interface](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/journey/6-dealing-with-generalization.html#extract-interface)

* Open `TriAthlete` and `JumpyAthlete` in `dealing.with.generalization` package

* Identify what should be in a common `trait`

```scala
// name + logger in an Athlete trait
// 1 interface for each capability
// Interface segreagetion principle
case class TriAthlete(name: String,
                      logger: BusinessLogger) {
  def swim(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name started swimming")

  def cycle(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name started cycling")

  def run(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name started running")
}

case class JumpyAthlete(name: String,
                        logger: BusinessLogger) {
  def swim(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name started swimming")

  def cycle(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name started cycling")

  def run(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name started running")

  def jump(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name is skydiving")
}
```

* Start by extracting an Athlete trait containing the name

```scala
trait Athlete {
  val name: String
  val logger: BusinessLogger
}
```

* Then extract traits for each capabilities
  * Right Click in the file
  * Select `Refactor | Extract Trait`

```scala
trait Cycle extends Athlete {
  def cycle(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name started cycling")
}

trait Jump extends Athlete {
  def jump(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name is skydiving")
}

trait Run extends Athlete {
  def run(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name started running")
}

trait Swim extends Athlete {
  def swim(): Unit = logger.log(s"$name started swimming")
}
```

* Use them in Athlete classes :

```scala
case class JumpyAthlete(name: String,
                        logger: BusinessLogger)
  extends Swim with Run with Cycle with Jump

case class TriAthlete(name: String,
                      logger: BusinessLogger) 
  extends Cycle with Run with Swim
```
