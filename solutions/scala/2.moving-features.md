# 2. Moving Features
## [Extract class](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/journey/2-moving-features.html#extract-class)

* Open `Player` in `moving.features` package
* Code smells

```scala
final case class Player(
   firstName: String,
   lastName: String,
   birthDate: LocalDate,
   height: Int,
   weight: Int,
   rating: Int,
   pace: Int,
   shooting: Int,
   passing: Int,
   dribbling: Int,
   defending: Int,
   physicality: Int
 ) {
def canDribble(otherPlayer: Player): Boolean =
  physicality + dribbling > otherPlayer.physicality + otherPlayer.defending
}
```

* In java `Refactor | Extract Delegate` not available in scala
  * Do it manually

* Extract attributes fields in a case class `Attributes`

```scala
final case class Attributes(
     rating: Int,
     pace: Int,
     shooting: Int,
     passing: Int,
     dribbling: Int,
     defending: Int,
     physicality: Int
)
```

* Compose `Player` with this new class

```scala
final case class Player(
       firstName: String,
       lastName: String,
       birthDate: LocalDate,
       height: Int,
       weight: Int,
       attributes: Attributes
) {
  def canDribble(otherPlayer: Player): Boolean =
    attributes.physicality + attributes.dribbling > otherPlayer.attributes.physicality + otherPlayer.attributes.defending
}

```

* Change the tests to inject `Attributes`

```scala
private val mane = Player(
  firstName = "Sadio",
  lastName = "ManÃ©",
  birthDate = LocalDate.of(1992, 10, 4),
  height = 175,
  weight = 69,
  Attributes(
    pace = 94,
    passing = 80,
    physicality = 76,
    rating = 90,
    shooting = 85,
    dribbling = 90,
    defending = 79
  )
)

private val pogba = Player(
  firstName = "Paul",
  lastName = "Pogba",
  birthDate = LocalDate.of(1994, 3, 3),
  height = 191,
  weight = 84,
  Attributes(
    pace = 73,
    passing = 86,
    physicality = 85,
    rating = 86,
    shooting = 81,
    dribbling = 85,
    defending = 66
  )
)

private val vanDijk = Player(
  firstName = "Virgil",
  lastName = "van Dijk",
  birthDate = LocalDate.of(1991, 8, 7),
  height = 193,
  weight = 92,
  Attributes(
    pace = 76,
    passing = 71,
    physicality = 86,
    rating = 90,
    shooting = 60,
    dribbling = 72,
    defending = 91
  )
)
```


## [Hide Delegate](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/journey/2-moving-features.html#hide-delegate)

- Open `ChampionsLeague` in `moving.features` package
- Locate the delegation

```scala
final case class ChampionsLeague(teams: List[Team]) {
  def nextStageTable: String =
    teams
      // Hide league delegation
      .map(team => s"${team.name} - ${team.league.country}")
      .mkString(lineSeparator)
}
```

![hide delegate](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/img/hideDelegate.webp)

* Add a country field in the `Team` class

```scala
final case class Team(name: String, league: League) {
  val country: String = league.country
}
```

* Refactor `ChampionsLeague` to use this new field

```scala
lazy val nextStageTable: String =
  teams.map(team => s"${team.name} - ${team.country}")
    .mkString(lineSeparator)
```

## [Remove Middleman](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/journey/2-moving-features.html#remove-middle-man)

* Remove the Middle Man introduced in the previous exercise (in `ChampionsLeague`)
* Can be done automatically by IntelliJ in java but not in Scala
