# 2. Moving Features
## [Extract class](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/journey/2-moving-features.html#extract-class)

* Open `Player` in `moving.features` package

* Code smells

```scala
package org.ythirion.refactoring.journey
package moving.features

import java.time.LocalDate

case class Player(firstName: String,
                  lastName: String,
                  birthDate: LocalDate,
                  height: Int,
                  weight: Int,
                  // Player attributes start here
                  // Create a composition
                  rating: Int,
                  pace: Int,
                  shooting: Int,
                  passing: Int,
                  dribbling: Int,
                  defending: Int,
                  physicality: Int) {
  def canDribble(otherPlayer: Player): Boolean = physicality + dribbling > otherPlayer.physicality + otherPlayer.defending
}
```

* In java `Refactor | Extract Delegate` not available in scala
  * Do it manually

* Extract attributes fields in a case class `Attributes`

```scala
case class Attributes(rating: Int,
                      pace: Int,
                      shooting: Int,
                      passing: Int,
                      dribbling: Int,
                      defending: Int,
                      physicality: Int)
```

* Compose `Player` with this new class

```scala
case class Player(firstName: String,
                  lastName: String,
                  birthDate: LocalDate,
                  height: Int,
                  weight: Int,
                  attributes: Attributes) {
  def canDribble(otherPlayer: Player): Boolean =
    attributes.physicality + attributes.dribbling > otherPlayer.attributes.physicality + otherPlayer.attributes.defending
}
```

* Change the tests to inject `Attributes`

```scala
private val mane = Player(firstName = "Sadio", lastName = "ManÃ©", birthDate = LocalDate.of(1992, 10, 4), height = 175, weight = 69,
  Attributes(pace = 94, passing = 80, physicality = 76, rating = 90, shooting = 85, dribbling = 90, defending = 79))

private val pogba = Player(firstName = "Paul", lastName = "Pogba", birthDate = LocalDate.of(1994, 3, 3), height = 191, weight = 84,
  Attributes(pace = 73, passing = 86, physicality = 85, rating = 86, shooting = 81, dribbling = 85, defending = 66))

private val vanDijk = Player(firstName = "Virgil", lastName = "van Dijk", birthDate = LocalDate.of(1991, 8, 7), height = 193, weight = 92,
  Attributes(pace = 76, passing = 71, physicality = 86, rating = 90, shooting = 60, dribbling = 72, defending = 91))
```



## [Hide Delegate](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/journey/2-moving-features.html#hide-delegate)

- Open `ChampionsLeague` in `moving.features` package
- Locate the delegation

```scala
case class ChampionsLeague(teams: List[Team]) {
  // Hide league delegation
  def nextStageTable: String = teams.map(team => s"${team.name} - ${team.league.country}").mkString("\n")
}
```

![hide delegate](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/img/hideDelegate.webp)

* Add a country field in the `Team` class

```scala
case class Team(name: String, league: League) {
  val country: String = league.country
}
```

* Refactor `ChampionsLeague` to use this new field

```scala
def nextStageTable: String =
  teams.map(team => s"${team.name} - ${team.country}")
    .mkString("\n")
```



## [Remove Middleman](https://ythirion.github.io/refactoring-journey/journey/2-moving-features.html#remove-middle-man)

* Remove the Middle Man introduced in the previous exercise (in `ChampionsLeague`)
* Can be done automatically by IntelliJ in java but not in Scala
